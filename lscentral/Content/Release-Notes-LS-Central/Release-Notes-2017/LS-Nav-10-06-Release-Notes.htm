                                        <h2 class="RelNotes-2">Adjust Coverage Calculation Time Horizon (From-Date)</h2>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">This fix is for the Effective Inventory calculation, using calculation type <i>Coverage</i>. </p>
                                        <p>In this calculation type, Sales Orders (Purchase Orders, Transfer Orders) were considered within a time range from tomorrow ("WORKDATE + 1") until the defined time horizon in the <b>Replenishment Setup</b>. This created problems in the calculation:&#160;if delayed and/or undelivered, orders remained in the system. Replenishment proposed to reorder these orders when their shipment/receipt date went into the past, because they went out of the calculation horizon.</p>
                                        <p>The lower date range has now been changed to zero date (0D). This means that the Effective Inventory calculation now regards all undelivered/delayed orders with a delivery/receipt date in the past as being "on the way". The calculation will not propose substitute orders, unless the user deletes the old orders. This is according to standard NAV principles.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">Hierarchy Relations is a new concept in LS Nav which lets you create relations between two Hierarchies of the same or different type.  A Hierarchy is a flexible tree structure with Nodes which allows the linking of Items, Deals, Stores, and other entities to the Nodes.</p>
                                        <p>This concept can be used for multiple purposes, one of which is the creation of Assortments. To define an Assortment a relation is created between an item-based Hierarchy and a store-based Hierarchy to define which items are available/replenished in which stores.</p>
                                        <p>The assortment rules are stored in the <b>Item Distribution</b> table which can be maintained on the <b>Retail Item Card</b>, FastTab <b>Distribution</b>. Hierarchy Relations can be used to maintain this information in a simpler and faster way. Hierarchy Relations also let you update the relevant tables manually or via Scheduler Job.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">In this release new calculation types for Planned Sales Demand are added. In previous releases a forecast quantity could only be substituted with a planned substitute quantity. With this release new types are introduced to add to the forecast quantity with absolute numbers or % factors. This makes it very easy to cover complex demand changes (overlapping effects) or demand changes for heterogeneous destinations (varying store sizes, regional aspects).</p>
                                        <p>New fields, <b>Line No., Planned Demand Type, Planned Demand Event,</b> and <b>Status</b> have been added to the <b>Replen. Planned Sales Demand</b> (10012374) table and the <b>Replen. Planned Sales Demand</b> (10012322) page.</p>
                                        <p>Also, the <b>Planned Demand (Qty.)</b> field has been renamed to <b>Planned Demand</b>.</p>
                                        <p>Three types of <b>Planned Demand Type</b> can now be selected from the <b>Replen. Planned Sales Demand</b> page:&#160;</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes"><b>Planned Sales Demand</b> lines can now be linked to a <b>Planned Sales Demand Event</b> and be maintained directly from the <b>Event</b> page. Prior to this release, Planned Sales Demand could only be maintained manually on the <b>Retail Item Card</b>, which is inconvenient, especially when a large number of items is involved. As a solution to this, a new <b>Replen. Planned Events</b> (10012326) page has been introduced to allow maintenance of Planned Sales Demand in one place. The page can be found in <b>LS Retail - Replenishment - Automatic - Replenishment Planned Events</b>.</p>

                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Linking Planned Sales Demand to Discounts and Budgets</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">Planned Sales Demand is a component of Automatic Replenishment and influences the proposals for Purchase Orders and Transfer Orders. Linking the Planned Sales Demand to Budgets and Discounts lets the user plan promotions or seasonal sales which are picked up and considered by Replenishment.</p>
                                        <p>An event can be linked to Periodic Discount or Retail Sales Budget and Planned Sales Demand can then be directly created from the Periodic Discount or Retail Sales Budget by using the <b>Update Lines</b> action. Currently, Discount Offers and Multibuy Discounts are supported, and the Retail Sales Budget must have <b>Budget Type</b> <i>Item,</i> <b>Period Type</b> <i>Day</i>, and budget entries with Store No.</p>
                                        <p>In order to allow Periodic Discount to be used for Planned Sales Demand creation, a new <b>Replenishment</b> FastTab is added to the <b>Discount Offer</b> (99001594) and <b>Multibuy Discount</b> (99001599) pages. The FastTab consists of the new fields <b>Planned Demand Type, Planned Demand</b>, and <b>Consider Calendar.</b> Two new fields, <b>Planned Demand Type</b> and <b>Planned Demand</b>, have also been added to the <b>Lines</b> FastTab in these pages. Planned Sales Demand is created according to the <b>Validation Period ID</b> and <b>Price Group</b> assigned to the discount. Retail Calendar or Base Calendar can also be taken into consideration, where non-working days will be excluded from Planned Sales Demand creation. This can be setup with the <b>Consider Calendar</b> field in the <b>Replenishment</b> FastTab.</p>
                                        <p>In order to allow Retail Sales Budget to be used for Planned Sales Demand creation, a <b>Replenishment</b> FastTab, consisting of the new fields <b>Planned Demand Type, Consider Calendar</b>, and <b>Allocation Rule Code</b> has been added to the <b>Retail Sales Budget Card</b> (10012418).</p>

                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Transformation of Budgets</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">In order to allow Retail Sales Budget to be used for Planned Sales Demand creation, the budget has to be on Day, Item, and Store level.  Three new actions, <b>Breakdown to Days, Breakdown to Items</b>, and <b>Breakdown to Stores</b>, have been added to the <b>Retail Sales Budget</b> (10012417) page so that all types of budgets can be converted to the required format for Planned Sales Demand creation.</p>
                                        <p>The <b>Breakdown to Days</b> action will break down budgets that are not in <b>Period Type</b> <i>Day</i> (that is Year, Quarter, Month, or Week) to <i>Day</i>. Similar to Periodic Discount, the action can also take into consideration the Retail Calendar or Base Calendar when performing the breakdown, where non-working days will be excluded from entries creation. The quantity in the initial budget entry will be evenly distributed to the new entries.</p>
                                        <p>The <b>Breakdown to Items</b> action will break down budgets that are not in <b>Budget Type</b> <i>Item</i> (that is Division, Item Category, or Product Group) to <i>Item</i>. Only items that are not blocked from purchasing or transferring will be considered. Similar to <b>Breakdown to Days</b>, the quantity in the initial budget entry will be evenly distributed to the new entries.</p>
                                        <p>A budget entry must have a Store No. in order for it to be usable for Planned Sales Demand creation. The <b>Breakdown to Stores</b> serves the purpose of breaking down budget entries without Store No., according to the <b>Allocation Rule Code</b> setup in the <b>Replenishment</b> FastTab. The quantity in the initial budget entry will be distributed to the new entries based on the weights and share % as per setup for each store in the Allocation Rule.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">Two approaches have been introduced to improve the performance of OOS calculation:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li value="1">Query based calculation approach - this can be enabled with the <b>OOS - Enable Query</b> field in <b>Replenishment Setup</b>. By enabling this functionality, the calculation codeunit (10012203, Replen. Out of Stock Mgt.) utilizes new Query objects to calculate OOS instead of the conventional nested loop table read approach. Due to fewer reads from the SQL server, enabling Query reduces the calculation time while it increases RAM consumption of the NAV service. It also produces more accurate results as <a href="#" class="MCTextPopup popup popupHead">backdated-posting<span class="MCTextPopupBody MCTextPopupBody_Closed needs-pie popupBody" aria-hidden="true"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Backdated-posting ILEs are entries that are posted with a future date but have an entry number prior to the last entry number processed by the OOS calculation.</span></a> item ledger entries (ILE) are taken into consideration when performing the OOS calculation.   </li>
                                            <li value="2">Parallel calculation approach - by enabling this functionality the items and ILEs to be calculated are put into a calculation bucket according to the number of existing parallel NAS and Schedulers. The calculation is done on the parallel NAS jobs and the master job on the primary NAS waits until the sub-jobs are finalized before it continues with other Scheduler jobs.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>These new approaches can be combined or used individually. A detailed description is available in the document <i>Replenishment Calculation using Multiple NAS LS Nav 2017 (10.06) Memo.pdf</i> in the Older Documentation folder delivered with the cumulative update.</p>

This allows easy maintenance of budget entries for individual stores in Retail Sales Budget and Retail Purchase Budget. The <b>Store No.</b> filter is defaulted with the <b>Store No.</b> from the Retail Sales Budget or Retail Purchase Budget page, but the filter can always be changed to another value. The budget lines are calculated according to the selected store in the filter. If no <b>Store No.</b> filter is selected, budget lines will be recalculated to show the consolidation of all entries. Also, the fields in the <b>Edit Retail Sales Budget</b> and <b>Edit Retail Purchase Budget</b> pages can now be drilled down to show an overview of the budget entries created</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">The Hierarchy system's user interface has been rewritten;&#160;pages have been combined for improved overview.</p>
                                        <p>There are now two types of Hierarchies in LS&#160;Nav:&#160;</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li value="1">Item/Deal: for a Hierarchy containing links to Items and Deals. </li>

                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Hierarchy Relations is a new concept in LS Nav which lets you relate Nodes in two different Hierarchies of the same or different Hierarchy type. <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Default.TopNavOnly">See the <a href="#Hierarchy" class="MCXref xref">Hierarchy Relations for Assortment Management</a> section in these Release Notes for more details on Hierarchy Relations. </MadCap:conditionalText> </p>
                                        <p>The<span> <b>Hierarchy</b> page</span> has been changed. Links are now added at the bottom of the page instead of being shown in a FactBox. By clicking the appropriate action, it is now possible to add a Sibling or a Child directly to a selected node. Hierarchy information is now displayed in a FactBox. Links can be copied from one node to another by right-clicking the selected links. Multiple links can be added to nodes using the respective <b>Add</b> actions where filters can be set.</p>
                                        <p>Item, deal, and store links to a Hierarchy can be managed directly from their list or card pages.</p>
                                        <p>The <b>Use Distribution</b> field has been removed from the <b>Hierarchy</b> table. Hierarchies of  the Item/Deal type can be filtered to a store and this can be done directly on the <b>Hierarchy Viewer</b> page. Attributes can be managed directly on the <b>Hierarchy Viewer</b> page and saved as default.</p>
                                        <p>The web service GET_HIERARCHY_TREE was renamed to GET_HIERARCHY. Both GET_HIERARCHY and GET_HIERARCHY_NODE now support deals/stores. A hierarchy is now retrieved by its code and not by a Web Store number. The Hierarchy code for a web store is kept in the WI Setup table with other web store information.</p>
                                        <p>The term "tree" has been removed from the Hierarchy functionality. For nodes, the terms Parent, Sibling, and Child are used. </p>
