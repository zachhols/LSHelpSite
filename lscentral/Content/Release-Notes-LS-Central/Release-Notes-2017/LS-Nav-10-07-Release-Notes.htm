                                        <p>This version is built on Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017, build no. <span id="navBuildNo">16996</span>.</p>
                                        <p><b>Note: </b>
                                            <br />The 64-bit client is now the default client when opening NAV.<br /></p>
                                        <p>In this version the POS is only supported to run on the 32-bit Dynamics NAV Windows client. We recommend setting up the 32-bit client in the LS Nav Start tool for the POS.</p>
                                        <p>The following is a list of changes and key features in LS&#160;Nav 2017 (10.07).</p>

                                        <h3 class="RelNotes-2">New Planned Demand Types</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">In this release, new calculation types for Planned Sales Demand have been added. Previously, a forecast quantity could only be substituted with a planned substitute quantity. In this release new types have been added to increase the forecast quantity with absolute numbers or % factors. This makes it very easy to cover complex demand changes (overlapping effects) or demand changes for heterogeneous destinations (varying store sizes, regional aspects).</p>
                                        <p>New fields, <b>Line No., Planned Demand Type, Planned Demand Event,</b> and <b>Status, </b>have been added to the Replen. Planned Sales Demand (10012374) table and Replen. Planned Sales Demand (10012322) page.</p>
                                        <p>The <b>Planned Demand (Qty.)</b> field has been renamed to <b>Planned Demand</b>.</p>
                                        <p>Three types of <b>Planned Demand Type </b>can now be selected from the <b>Replen. Planned Sales Demand </b>page:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li value="1"><b>Substitute Quantity </b>- the input <b>Planned Demand</b> will be used to substitute the average daily sales of the affected item.</li>

                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Planned Sales Demand Events</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">Above all, Planned Sales Demand lines can now be linked to a Planned Sales Demand Event and directly maintained from the Event page. Prior to this release, Planned Sales Demand could only be maintained manually in the <b>Retail Item Card</b>. This is inconvenient, especially when a large number of items are involved. As a solution to this, a new Replen. Planned Events (10012326) page has been introduced to allow maintenance of Planned Sales Demand in one place. The page can be found in <b>LS Retail - Replenishment - Automatic - Replenishment Planned Events</b>.</p>
                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Simple Maintenance of Planned Sales Demand</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">Planned Sales Demand is easily maintained by using the <b>Add Lines</b> and <b>Remove Lines</b> actions in the page for Planned Sales Demand Events. Those actions let the user add (or remove) Planned Sales Demand lines by using reports with a big variety of filters.</p>
                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Linking Planned Sales Demand to Discounts and Budgets</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">Planned Sales Demand is a component of Automatic Replenishment and influences the proposals for Purchase Orders and Transfer Orders. Linking the Planned Sales Demand to Budgets and Discounts lets the user plan promotions or seasonal sales which are picked up and considered by Replenishment.</p>
                                        <p>An event can be linked to Periodic Discount or Retail Sales Budget and a Planned Sales Demand can then be created directly from the Periodic Discount or Retail Sales Budget by using the <b>Update Lines </b>action. Currently, Discount Offers and Multibuy Discounts are supported, and the Retail Sales Budget must have <b>Budget Type</b> <i>Item</i>, <b>Period Type </b><i>Day</i>, and budget entries with <i>Store No</i>.</p>
                                        <p>In order to allow Periodic Discount to be used for Planned Sales Demand creation, a new <b>Replenishment </b>FastTab consisting of the new fields <b>Planned Demand Type, Planned Demand,</b> and <b>Consider Calendar</b> has been added to the Discount Offer (99001594) and Multibuy Discount (99001599) pages.  Two new fields, <b>Planned Demand Type </b>and <b>Planned Demand, </b>have also been added to the <b>Lines </b>FastTab in these pages. Planned Sales Demand are created according to the <b>Validation Period ID </b>and <b>Price Group</b> assigned to the discount. Retail Calendar or Base Calendar can also be taken into consideration, where non-working days will be excluded from the Planned Sales Demand creation. This can be setup with the <b>Consider Calendar</b> field on the <b>Replenishment </b>FastTab.</p>
                                        <p>In order to allow Retail Sales Budget to be used for Planned Sales Demand creation, a <b>Replenishment</b> FastTab, consisting of the new fields <b>Planned Demand Type, Consider Calendar</b>, and <b>Allocation Rule Code</b>, has been added to the Retail Sales Budget Card (10012418).</p>
                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Transformation of Budgets</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">In order to allow Retail Sales Budget to be used for Planned Sales Demand creation, the budget has to be on Day, Item and Store level.  Three new actions <b>Breakdown to Days, Breakdown to Items,</b> and <b>Breakdown to Stores </b>have been added to the Retail Sales Budget (10012417) page so that all types of budgets can be converted to the required format for a Planned Sales Demand creation.</p>
                                        <p>The <b>Breakdown to Days </b>action will break down budgets that are not in the <b>Period Type </b><i>Day</i> (that is <i>Year, Quarter, Month,</i> or <i>Week</i>) to <i>Day</i>. Similar to Periodic Discount, the action can also take into consideration the Retail Calendar or Base Calendar when performing the breakdown, where non-working days will be excluded from entries creation. The quantity in the initial budget entry will be evenly distributed to the new entries.</p>
                                        <p>The <b>Breakdown to Items </b>action will break down budgets that are not in <b>Budget Type</b> <i>Item</i> (that is <i>Division, Item Category,</i> or <i>Product Group</i>) to <i>Item</i>. Only items that are not blocked from purchasing or transferring will be considered. Similar to <b>Breakdown to Days</b>, the quantity in the initial budget entry will be evenly distributed to the new entries.</p>
                                        <p>A budget entry must have a Store No. in order for it to be usable for Planned Sales Demand creation. The <b>Breakdown to Stores </b>serves the purpose to breaking down budget entries without a Store No., according to the <b>Allocation Rule Code </b>setup in the <b>Replenishment </b>FastTab. The quantity in the initial budget entry will be distributed to the new entries based on the weights and share percentage as per setup for each store in the Allocation Rule.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">A <b>Store No. </b>filter has been introduced in the Edit Retail Sales Budget (10012416) and Edit Retail Purchase Budget (10012415) pages. This allows easy maintenance of budget entries for individual stores in Retail Sales Budget and Retail Purchase Budget. </p>
                                        <p>The <b>Store No. </b>filter is defaulted with the Store No. from the Retail Sales Budget or Retail Purchase Budget page but it can always be changed to another value. The budget lines are calculated according to the selected store in the filter. If no <b>Store No.</b> filter is selected then budget lines will be recalculated to show the consolidation of all entries. </p>
                                        <p>Also, the fields in the Edit Retail Sales Budget and Edit Retail Purchase Budget pages can now be drilled down to show an overview of the budget entries created.</p>

This field lets users specify if a budget can be consolidated into master budget. </p>
                                        <p>A new <b>Calculate Budget from Child Budgets </b>action has also been introduced in the Retail Sales Budget (10012417) page and the Retail Purchase Budget (10012419) page.
