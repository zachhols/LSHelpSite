                                        <p>This version is built on <span class="GeneralBC_Maxi">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central</span> 16.4.15445.</p>
                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Discontinuation of LS Nav</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">LS Retail policy for <span class="GeneralLSCentral_Mini">LS&#160;Central</span> is that new features and fixes go into the next new release, not previous releases.  When <span class="GeneralLSCentral_Mini">LS&#160;Central</span> 15.0, the first AL version, was released, it was decided to make an exception to this by continuing to release fixes and new events in LS Nav 14.x for a limited time. Now the time has come to end this exception. The last version of LS Nav 14, version 14.04,  will be released in October 2020.</p>
                                        <p>All open backlog issues related to versions prior to <span class="GeneralLSCentral_Mini">LS&#160;Central</span> 15.0, that is all backlog issues related to LS Nav, will be closed.  Partners can submit new support tickets for <span class="GeneralLSCentral_Mini">LS&#160;Central</span> if the issue still applies there.</p>

The release package includes both the runtime app and the source code.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">The source code is delivered in AL files that can be modified by partners. It is, however, highly recommended to make all modifications in extensions, and if you need to alter the <span class="GeneralLSCentral_Mini">LS&#160;Central</span> or <span class="GeneralBC_Mini">Business Central</span> behavior then do that by subscribing to events.</p>
                                        <p>It is LS Retail's priority to make it easy for the partners to extend <span class="GeneralLSCentral_Mini">LS&#160;Central</span>. Therefore, there is a special section in our Support Portal where partners can submit requests for new events. These requests are given priority.</p>

                                        <h2 class="RelNotesSection">New or Enhanced Features</h2>
                                        <h2 class="RelNotesProdGroup">Retail</h2>
                                        <h2 class="RelNotes-2">Customer Order</h2>
                                        <h3 class="RelNotes-2">Partial Pick, Ship and Collect Customer Order</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">Customer Order can be picked, collected, and shipped per line. This adds great flexibility to the Customer Order processes and allows the user to split the fulfillment of the Customer Order into multiple steps. As an example, a user can pick goods in one area first, confirm the picking of those items, and then later pick to goods in another area, for example if some goods are stored in a cooler and other items in dry storage, the picking in the two areas can be split.</p>
                                        <p>In the picking and shipping process on the POS the user can process individual lines. The line can be marked as<i> picked</i> if the item is picked. A line can be <i>canceled </i>if the customer does not want the item anymore, and a line can be marked as <i>shortage </i>if it is out of stock.  If a line is not Picked, Cancelled or Shorted, it will stay unpicked and can be picked at a later time.  The same goes with the collection and shipping process on the POS, the user can select what lines the customer is collecting or are getting shipped and the lines that are not collected/shipped can be collected/shipped later.</p>
                                        <p>To make this possible, several fields were moved from the<b> Customer Order Header</b> to the <b>Customer Order Lines</b>.  Upgrade codeunits are provided with the release to handle the transfer of data from the Customer Order Header to the Customer Order Lines. Several Customer Order web services had to be replaced by a new version of the web service to accommodate the refactoring.</p>
                                        <p>The partial processing applies to orders processed on a POS and to orders processed through a Sales Order.</p>
                                        <p>It is now possible to cancel one or more Customer Order lines in case the customer changes his or her mind and it is possible to cancel the whole order.</p>
                                        <h3 class="RelNotes">Customer Order POS Panels</h3>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">The Customer Order POS panels have been simplified and the look and feel made more consistent between different panels.</p>

                                            <li value="3">The<b> Customer Order Collect </b>panel shows a list of all Customer Orders that have at least one line with status <i>To Collect</i> and are to be collected from that store.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>A Customer Order can be present in both the<b> Pick</b> and <b>Collect</b> panels as some lines can have the status <i>To Pick</i> while others have the status <i>To Collect</i>.</p>
