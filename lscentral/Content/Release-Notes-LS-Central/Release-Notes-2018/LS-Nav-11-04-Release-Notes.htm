                                        <p>A&#160;new version of <b>LS Pay engine </b>is shipped with the Hardware Station. This new version of LS Pay engine has two additional plugins to payment providers:</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes"><b>Store Stock Redistribution</b> is a new functionality in LS Nav to replenish stores from other stores and/or warehouses.</p>
                                        <p>The new <b>Redistribution Replenishment Journal </b>is following the concept of the Purchase and Transfer Replenishment Journals but provides additional functionality which is specific for redistribution. Additional features are:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li value="1"><b>Calculation Types </b>like <i>Sales Demand, Stock Balancing</i>, and<i> Reorder Point/Max. Inventory </i>to calculate the Redist. Stock and Redist. Demand for the locations.</li>
                                            <li value="2"><b>Redistribution Strategies</b> like <i>Least. no. of Trips, Least Cost, Least Distance</i>, and <i>Least Duration</i> to calculate the optimal routes (trips) between locations with Redist. Demand and Redist. Stock.</li>
                                            <li value="3">Rules to define how stock in warehouse locations shall be treated (<i>Ignore, Force, Prioritize, Like Store Stock</i>).</li>
                                            <li value="4">Buffer values, to avoid too aggressive redistribution proposals.</li>
                                            <li value="5">New calculated fields, such s <i> Stockout%, Sell Through%</i>, and <i>Variant Availability%</i> to support the decision making, which items to redistribute.</li>
                                            <li value="6">New pages to help better understand the current stock situation for items with and without variants. The <b>Retail Item - Variant Dimension - Location Availability</b> page is also accessible from the<b> Retail Item Card</b> page in the <b>Retail Availability by </b>group.</li>
                                            <li value="7">Calculation Preview feature to review the calculated items and stores before the trips are calculated. Functionality to easily exclude items and/or locations from trips calculation is available.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The calculation result will show the <b>Redistribution Cost</b>, which is the total transportation cost of the trips and the <b>Expected Sales Increase </b>from having the right items at the right time at the right place.</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p><b>Redistribution Matrix</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="RelNotes">The <b>Redist. Matrix </b>defines the set of possible/allowed routes between locations for redistribution. It is based on the Hierarchies and Hierarchy Relations model to easily define the rules in a top-down approach with inheritance. In this matrix the <b>Redist. Cost</b>, the total cost of transport between two locations, is maintained. The <b>Redist. Matrix </b>also holds the duration and distance between two locations. The Matrix is used to define the possible/allowed rules and also to provide a sort order between multiple locations with Redist. Stock (supply), when the trips are calculated.</p>
                                        <p><b>Bing Maps API Integration</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>To calculate the optimal routes between locations, it is now possible to calculate geodata (latitude and longitude) for Stores and Locations on their card pages with Bing Maps API. The <b>Redist. Matrix </b>supports the calculation of route distance and duration between two locations by using the API integration.</p>
                                        <p><b>Lifecycle Curve</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Lifecycle Curves describe the sales behavior of items over a period - with different period types like<i> Month, Week, Day, </i>and period lengths. These curves are used to calculate expected future sales by considering historical sales data and the current stage in the product's life. Lifecycle Curves can be calculated from historical sales data for comparison periods, like previous seasons, years, etc. for brands (Special Groups), item groups and other criteria. The curves are assigned to items via the new field <b>Lifecycle Curve Code </b>on the <b>Retail Item Card</b> or via the new <b>Lifecycle Curve Links</b> page.</p>
                                        <p>Beside the new functionality, the LS Nav Replenishment menu has been improved for a better overview and navigation experience.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">It is now possible to configure the KDS Display Profile to show POS Tags in the Line Displays or Chits in the Kitchen Display System. This lets you decide what information to show on the Kitchen Displays, and if the system is customized for POS, then data from that customization can be sent to the KDS, if needed.</p>
                                        <p>It is also possible to define a POS tag and return a value of a table field. The POS tag also allows for a prefix and/or a postfix of the tag value.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">A new <b>KDS Printer </b>option for Kitchen Printers is now available. When this option is set, the POS sends the Kitchen Order Ticket (KOT) to the Kitchen Service which will then handle the printing.</p>
                                        <p>This is particularly useful for restaurants with many printers:&#160;because there is a modal window on the POS for each ticket, the POS is unavailable as long as tickets are being printed with the Windows Printing option.</p>

                                        <p>The structure for small devices contains only one grid at a time and switches between the table grid and the guest grid. The structure for stationary POS (larger devices) operates with two grids at a time in the same way as in previous versions.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">You can now set a time style (Time Style Profile Card) based on the percentage of cook time to highlight items that have been on a Display Station for 80% (or 110%) of its estimated cook time. Previous setting only allowed for setting the seconds passed after the cook time had passed.</p>
                                        <p>To set this up, set the <b>Time Style Settings </b>on the Kitchen Service Configuration card to <i>Percentage of cook time </i>,and set a <b>Default Cook Time </b>which is used if no cook time is set on an item.</p>
                                        <p>The following then applies for chit and line display stations:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li value="1">CHIT - apply based on the longest cook time of an item in the KOT.</li>

                                        <p>When there are a lot of lines or chits on the stations, this feature helps the chefs get a better overview of what is coming up. The chefs will see how many items there are on the display station, and they can also see how many items are due within the next X minutes (configurable) and how many after that.</p>
                                        <p>You can configure which items are grouped together and create an AggregateGroupProfile which is applied to a display station.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">This new feature shows the duration that an item has been on a kitchen display. </p>
                                        <p>This timer will always be the same as the <b>Production Time</b> field that is set on a chit or on the line display in the KDS Display Profile, unless the display station has the <b>Show only when bumped on prior stations </b>setting. Then the timer starts counting when the item has been bumped on all stations.</p>

                                        <p>This operation can be useful if the restaurant is very busy, and you need to transfer some chits from the main Expeditor station to a secondary Expeditor station to balance the load between the stations.</p>

                                        <p class="RelNotes">This has been fixed by changing where log files are saved.</p>
                                        <p>For client type windows (CLIENTTYPE::Windows ) the system handles log files the same way as before:&#160;the file is saved on the client's computer in the folder that is defined by the Web Service Setup.</p>
                                        <p>For other client types, including Web, the log file is saved on the server running the service tier for NAV.</p>
                                        <p>The log files are saved in the folder defined by the Web Service Setup, so a corresponding folder must exist on the computer running the service tier. <b>Note:&#160;</b> This is the service tier running the requesting client, not the responding service tier.</p>
                                        <p>The only reason for using web requests to get information from Head Office is, if the requesting client is not online on the HO server and the client is therefore running on some other server and that is the server where the logs will be saved.</p>
