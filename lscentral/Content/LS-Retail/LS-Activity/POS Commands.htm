                                            <MadCap:concept term="Hospitality" />Activity POS Commands</h1>
                                        <p>The LS Activity module can sell all activity products on the POS,&#160;and create the activity entries (reservations and appointments) in the backend system. In addition, it is possible to pay activities or whole reservations on the POS, provided they have been entered first in the backend. </p>
                                        <p>The POS operator can open the <b>Activity Card </b>or the <b>Reservation Card </b>from the POS, and even select specific resources, if the product sold requires manual resource assignment. The POS operator can select the activity or reservation (or even the client) to be paid by opening the relevant entry (or place the cursor on the selected entry) on the backend <span class="GeneralBC_Mini">Business Central</span>  pages, since if the POS session is running on the same Windows session, the POS will know which entry is selected.</p>
                                        <p>LS&#160;Activity can print tickets or reports, depending on what product is being sold at the POS. See <a href="Activity Product.htm" class="MCXref xref">Activity Products</a> settings for more detail.</p>
                                        <p><b>Note:</b> When the activity product is selected on the POS and the date/time is confirmed (based on availability lookup), the actual entry is created, and at that point the <a href="Activity Setup.htm#EntryStatus">POS Entry Status</a> (as set up in the <a href="Activity Setup.htm">LS Activity setup</a>) is assigned to the activity. Normally, this would be a status which keeps the activity entry as draft, but reserves the resources.</p>
                                        <p>When the sale is then posted, the optional <a href="Activity Setup.htm#PostingStatus">POS Posting Status</a> is assigned to the activities in the sale. This status would normally set the internal status of the activity to <i>Confirmed</i> and kick off confirmation emails to the customer. The POS assumes the activity location (to search for availability) as the current default location for the activity user (that is the Windows logon of the POS&#160;client), and it uses that location as the default for the reservations and activities created.</p>
                                        <p><b>Note:</b> Prior to using any of the POS commands listed below, you must register codeunits 10015833 and 10015821 as POS modules. See the <a href="../POS/Functionality/Commands.htm">LS Central Help</a> for details on registering new POS commands and modules.</p>
                                        <p><b>Note:</b> Commands that work with a currently active reservation or activity in the back office are not supported on the Web POS client, although they are supported in CU10015833 and can be used when running on the windows POS client. The Current POS&#160;commands might be supported in the future.</p>
                                        <p>The table below lists and describes the LS&#160;Activity POS&#160;commands. Use these alphabetical links to quickly navigate the table:</p>
